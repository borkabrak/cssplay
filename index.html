        <h1>CSS Menu</h1>

        <aside>
        Here is an implementation of a collapse/expand style menu.  It's done
        entirely in CSS, with no javascript.  It's not perfect, nor standard,
        but it's a fun thing to explore.  Hover over the markers to show the
        corresponding content.  (It just works in Google Chrome and Opera, for now.)

        What on earth would a man do with himself if something did not stand in his way?

                "In this replacement Earth we're building they've given me Africa
        to do and of course I'm doing it with all fjords again because I happen to
        like them, and I'm old-fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely
        baroque feel to a continent.  And they tell me it's not equatorial enough.
        Equatorial!"  He gave a hollow laugh.  "What does it matter?  Science has
        achieved some wonderful things, of course, but I'd far rather be happy than
        right any day."
                "And are you?"
                "No.  That's where it all falls down, of course."
                "Pity," said Arthur with sympathy.  "It sounded like quite a good
        life-style otherwise."

        Puritanism:
            the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy.
