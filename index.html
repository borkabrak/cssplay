        <h1>CSS Menu</h1>

        <aside>
        Here is an implementation of a collapse/expand style menu.  It's done
        entirely in CSS, with no javascript.  It's not perfect, nor standard,
        but it's a fun thing to explore.  Hover over the items to show their
        content.

          "In this replacement Earth we're building they've given me Africa
          to do and of course I'm doing it with all fjords again because I happen to
          like them, and I'm old-fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely
          baroque feel to a continent.  And they tell me it's not equatorial enough.
          Equatorial!"  He gave a hollow laugh.  "What does it matter?  Science has
          achieved some wonderful things, of course, but I'd far rather be happy than
          right any day."

          "And are you?"

          "No.  That's where it all falls down, of course."

          "Pity," said Arthur with sympathy.  "It sounded like quite a good
          life-style otherwise."
